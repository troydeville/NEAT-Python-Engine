# NEAT-Python-Engine

**This project is intended for use on the RaspberryPi utilizing the GPIO pins.**

This engine computes a NEAT model which is created by the NEAT-swift implementation found on my git.

Simply train a model in NEAT-swift, copy the genome's description, and paste the description into the model.txt file provided in this project. Then the pi can use the model to create the appropriate output response.
